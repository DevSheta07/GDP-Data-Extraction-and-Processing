# GDP Data Extraction and Processing

## Overview
This project extracts, cleans, and organizes GDP data from raw sources such as tables or spreadsheets, making it ready for analysis.

## Features
- Extract GDP data from raw datasets
- Clean and preprocess data (rename columns, filter rows, format values)
- Organize data into a structured format for analysis

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## How to Use

Follow these steps to run the GDP Data Extraction and Processing notebook:

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**  
   - If you have Jupyter installed locally, run:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
     Then open `GDPProject.ipynb` in the browser.  
   - Alternatively, you can use **VS Code** with the Jupyter extension or **Google Colab** to open the notebook online.

2. **Run the notebook cells**  
   - Execute the cells one by one in order to extract, clean, and process the GDP data.

3. **View the results**  
   - The processed GDP data will appear as outputs in the notebook cells.  
   - If your notebook saves results to a file (e.g., `Largest_economies.csv`), you can check that file in the project folder.

4. **Install dependencies (if needed)**  
   Ensure the required Python libraries are installed:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```
